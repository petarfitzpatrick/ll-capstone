# Coursera Capstone

This is my capstone submission for Meta's Frontend Developer Course

## Changes

I had created this in a seperate private repository so I have moved the work over to be accessed publically. I will move back to the private branch at the end of the course.

## Running My Project
### `npm install`

To install necessary dependencies on your machine

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
